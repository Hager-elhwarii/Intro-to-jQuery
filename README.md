## About this course
With HTML and CSS, you can build visually appealing static web pages. With a bit of JavaScript, you can add dynamic behavior to these static websites.

jQuery is a JavaScript library that provides you with a lot of dynamic behavior “out-of-the-box”, allowing you to add some creative effects to otherwise dull layouts.

## Take-Away Skills:
You will learn how to add jQuery to web pages and how to traverse the DOM. You’ll also learn how to use effects, event handlers and style methods.
