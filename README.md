## 🌸 About this Repo
- With HTML and CSS, you can build visually appealing static web pages. With a bit of `JavaScript`, you can add dynamic behavior to these static websites.

- `jQuery` is a JavaScript library that provides you with a lot of dynamic behavior “out-of-the-box”, allowing you to add some creative effects to otherwise dull layouts.

## 🤸 Take-Away Skills:
> - You will learn how to add jQuery to web pages and how to traverse the `DOM`. You’ll also learn how to use effects, `event handlers` and style methods.
