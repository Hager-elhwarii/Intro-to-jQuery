## 🌸 About this Repo
- With HTML and CSS, you can build visually appealing static web pages. With a bit of JavaScript, you can add dynamic behavior to these static websites.

- jQuery is a JavaScript library that provides you with a lot of dynamic behavior “out-of-the-box”, allowing you to add some creative effects to otherwise dull layouts.

## 🤸 Take-Away Skills:
- You will learn how to add jQuery to web pages and how to traverse the DOM. You’ll also learn how to use effects, event handlers and style methods.
